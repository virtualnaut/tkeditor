  <h2>Saving, Exporting and Opening Files<h2>
  
  <h3>Saving</h3>
  <p>
  To save a file, click on the 'save' icon in the menu window. 
  This will bring up a file explorer dialog where the location
  and name of the file can be entered.<br><br>
  tkEditor project files should have the extension '.tkw'.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Opening</h3>
  <p>
  To open a file, click on the 'load' icon in the menu window. 
  This will bring up a file explorer dialog where the desired 
  .tkw file can be selected.<br><br>
  Be aware that loading a file will lose all unsaved data in the 
  currently open project. A prompt will appear to confirm the 
  opening of a file, when one is selected in the file explorer.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Exporting</h3>
  <p>
  To export a tkEditor window to a Python file, click on the 'export' 
  icon in the menu window. This will bring up a file explorer dialog 
  where the location and name of the Python file can be entered.<br><br>
  Exported files have the '.pyw' extension, which is the extension 
  for a Python file with no console. Running this file will display 
  the window that was exported.
